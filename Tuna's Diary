Day 1: Today i ate some worms and chilled out in the coral reef
Day 2: Today a shark almost ate me but then i got away and he ate my friend called cobalt
Day 3: Today there was a really juicy worm swimming around and i ate it but it had some spiky thing in its stomach and it had some turbo 
    power because it pulled me to the surface then i got put in a bin with some other fish
